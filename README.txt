In particular it simulates the idea of rain falling. Each time an ellipse falls, it resets its position at the top of the screen, with a random size, colour, falling speed, wave size and position in the x axis - its aim being to create interesting patterns and motion whilst they fall across the screen. -User Input-The user is able to increase the trail left by falling circles to draw out a wave pattern. By pressing down and holding the mouse, the user is able to draw wave like patterns and create interesting outcomes. Upon releasing the mouse press, the drawn out lines will vanish. -Inspiration-The idea to use wave like motion came from inspiration from some artists, including Jason Karolak, Marius Watz and Bridget Riley. For example, Jason Karolak's' artwork is quite unique in the way lines and shapes are placed in space to build up a structure of colour and shape. Similar to Marius Watz who also works on the idea of bold colour within the different shapes, waves and lines. Bridget Riley also experimented with the use of lines and curves. However, some of her best work was how the simplicity of the shapes she uses form interesting repetition and patterns, particularity within waves and circular forms. -Development Process-During the development process, the potential ideas were broken down to decide what could potentially be included in the final piece. Based on the inspiration from the artists, planning and experimenting, the code was developed to a point that was interesting and presented the idea of waves falling like rain to create a generative pattern. The HTML and CSS were then stylised to suit the JavaScript canvas and make it more visually pleasing to the viewer. -Issues and Improvements-Some obstacles were hit during the development of the program. One of these issues encountered was when incorporating more interactivity into the program. Not only was it a difficult process to try and add things such as an adjustment slider into the code, when it was added to adjust different elements it didn’t provide the desired improvement and made the waves/shapes “unattractive”. However, for future development, the final outcome could be more interesting if the canvas itself was more interactive. For example, it would be more engaging if the user could change some of the settings, such as the falling speed, wave amplitude, size of the ellipse and the direction using a slider or key press, whilst keeping the program “looking appealing”.
